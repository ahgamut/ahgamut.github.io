title: About Me
---

My name is Gautham. I like programming with numbers.
This blog is for me to practice writing.

I am currently a graduate student in the Statistics program at [Iowa State
University](https://stat.iastate.edu).

Until quite recently I was at [Maya Labs](https://mayalabs.io) ([YC
S22](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/maya-labs)), working on program
synthesis.

I graduated from [BITS Pilani](https://bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/index.aspx) in
2019 with degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science.

All opinions on this blog are my own.

The blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
The blog theme is a fork of [Etch](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch), but
before that it was a fork of [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon).

My username on Github is [`ahgamut`](https://github.com/ahgamut).
You can contact me at `github-username` <at> gmail <dot> com.
