title: About Me
---

My name is Gautham. I like programming with numbers.
This blog is for me to practice writing about programming and math. 

Until quite recently I was working at Maya Labs (see [here](https://mayalabs.io)
and [here](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/maya-labs)), on program
synthesis. 

I graduated from [BITS Pilani](https://bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/index.aspx) with
degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science.

All opinions on this blog are my own.

The blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
The blog theme is a fork of [Etch](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch).
