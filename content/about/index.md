title: About Me
---

My name is Gautham. This blog is for me to practice writing about programming,
and hopefully some math too. 

I am currently working at [Maya Robotics](https://mayahq.com), on program
synthesis. I graduated from [BITS Pilani](https://bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/index.aspx) with
degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science.

All opinions on this blog are my own.

The blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
The blog theme is a fork of [Etch](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch).
