title: About Me
---

My name is Gautham. I like programming with numbers.  This blog is for me to
practice writing. I am currently a graduate student in the Statistics program at
[Iowa State University](https://stat.iastate.edu). 

My username on Github is [`ahgamut`](https://github.com/ahgamut). If you're at
this page, either you know me already or you got here via my blog posts. You can
contact me at `github-username <at> gmail <dot> com`. I am looking for
internships in the winter/summer.

A while back I was at [Maya Labs](https://mayalabs.io) ([YC
S22](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/maya-labs)), working on program
synthesis. I graduated from [BITS
Pilani](https://wwww.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani) in 2019 with degrees in
Mathematics and Computer Science.

All opinions on this blog are my own.

The blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).  The blog theme is a fork of
[Listed](https://github.com/ronv/listed), but before that it was
[Etch](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch), and
[Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon).
